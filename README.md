# Rust-Based Platform with MongoDB Database

This is a platform built using the Rust programming language and MongoDB database. It is designed to provide similar functionalities to Firebase, including user authentication and real-time database.

## Features

The platform includes the following features:

- User authentication: users can sign up, log in, and reset their passwords.
- Real-time database: data is stored and synchronized in real-time between clients and the server.

## Technology Stack

- Rust: the main programming language used to develop the platform.
- MongoDB: the database used to store data.
- Rocket: a web framework for Rust used to handle HTTP requests.
- WebSocket: a protocol used to enable real-time communication between clients and the server.

## Installation

To install and run the platform, follow these steps:

1. Install Rust and MongoDB on your system.
2. Clone the repository using the command `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git`.
3. Navigate to the project directory using the command `cd yourproject`.
4. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and update the values with your own credentials.
5. Start the server using the command `cargo run`.
6. Access the platform by navigating to `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser.

## Usage

The platform can be used to build web or mobile applications that require user authentication, real-time database, and cloud messaging. To use the platform in your application, follow these steps:

1. Create a new project in the platform.
2. Add users to the project and define their roles and permissions.
3. Create a new database collection and define its schema.
4. Connect your application to the platform's real-time database using the WebSocket protocol.
5. Use the platform's APIs to authenticate users and perform CRUD operations on the database.

## Contributing

If you want to contribute to the platform, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
